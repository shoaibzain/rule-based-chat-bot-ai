## Features

- **Rule-Based Logic:** Responds based on predefined rules and triggers.
- **Customizable Responses:** Easily modify or add new responses to suit your needs.
- **No AI Dependencies:** Completely built on logical conditionals without machine learning.
- **Easy Maintenance:** Simple structure for quick updates and extensions.
